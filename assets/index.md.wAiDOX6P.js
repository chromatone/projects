My name is Denis Starov. I'm the author and developer of Chromatone - the Visial Music Language. I found a point where ideas of Isaac Newton meet modern technology and science. Now we can establish consistent relations between notes and colors and bring visual awareness to music analysis, performance, composition and production. The same notes across octaves, frets and bars will have the same color and even rhythms!\\n\\nHundreds of students all around the world are already using my instrument stickers, printed memos and interactive web-apps to study, practice and improve their music skills. Real life face to face group study appears to be at the core of any human educational system. My 8+ years experience of self-guided music research and multimedia production as well as release of my first video-course on Visual Music Theory have shown high educational potential of Chromatone system. Dozens of students graduated with their own composed songs.\\n\\nAt some point I've discovered 4 main perspectives from which we can look at music and multimedia art together.\\n\\nVisual Music Theory helps understanding rhythms, notes, intervals, chords and scales, Collaborative Jam Performance is a way to enjoy implementing this knowledge with others, Live Multimedia Production focuses on recording and processing content while Creative Web-Development is about apps and their features. And together they are a framework to express yourself through the means of modern multimedia technology.\\n\\nI will share my experience, help you build your own knowledge and plan of action to develop sufficient skills to use it creatively. You are free to use all this for your self-expression!\\n\\n## Group classes every Tuesday ​\\n\\n### Sessions start at 11:00 and 12:45 ​\\n\\n- 4-8 students per class\\n- interactive lesson\\n- hands-on practice\\n- creative homework\\n\\n## Guided education sessions ​\\n\\n### Presentation - 30 min ​\\n\\nTightly packed prepared comprehensive overview of a given topic with a slideshow and interactive examples. This part may be recorded and published online for students later reference. Students write down their questions and ideas to share in the next part.\\n\\n### Discovery - 30 min ​\\n\\nStudents ask questions and verify their model of given topic with the teacher and other students. Everyone is encouraged to find something useful for creative multimedia project, that we'll be creating in the next part.\\n\\n### Performance - 30 min ​\\n\\nWe use all the knowledge, understanding and expertise present in the classroom to create some short piece of content, that will incorporate just studied wide topics in relation to creative processes.\\n\\n### + Homework ​\\n\\nAnother piece of content students will be asked to make themselves through the week until next class. From just a screenshot of an app to a full song - you grow from your level with us! We will have 15 minutes before and after the lesson to check and discuss your homework done or to be done.\\n\\n### + FREE: Biweekly workshops and jams ​\\n\\n- 1 hour workshop\\n- Rooftop jam session till 11PM\\n\\n## Prototyping efficient educational models \\n\\nWhile being fundamentally different, sensations converge in our brains so we can build any kinds of connections there. That's how anyone may once see sounds and music in color. That's how I studied music myself: with colorful stickers applied on the keyboard of my OP-1 and a memo cheatsheet with diagrams of all chords in basic diatonic scales to put at sight and go with all this to any rehearsal or jam place to start exploring this tonal space with other musicians.\\n\\nAnd then I realized how valuable those unique moments of joy are when people play together in sync, and got immersed in live music more and more. While having published tracks and experience in many other fields, live jam performance is in my focus for many years and from many perspectives.\\n\\nAround year 2017 it all started as web development excercise app just to calculate the frequency of note A 40th octave and compare it to light spectrum. After I saw red A and how octave fits with color circle, I never stopped developing this project further. It has grown into a web-site, a sticker shop, a video-course, a book in the making. Now Chromatone is quite a developed research with plenty of theory and practice materials ready to be shared with people from around the world.\\n\\nOnline tutorship and video courses are not really that effective as we are quite used to watch videos with no interaction with others. But interactions with other students inside and outside the classroom is integral part of study and growth. As an adult you want effective education for students of any level of prior knowledge and achievable knowledge and skills for all. And I want to explore this field more by starting to grow a creative multimedia school with 4 programs to provide valuable knowledge and skills to both local and global communities of music explorers.\\n\\nDynamic group education is an important part of study process as it provides opportunities to also ask questions and explain something to others so that you better understand the subject yourself.","team":[7],"updates":[20,21],"events":[],"program":{"title":"Visual Music Theory"},"cover":{"id":"4b35477f-fd75-4b09-a2c3-d4f2a3c38fdd"}},{"id":"a00f8204-b988-4bb4-bdee-3538c6e333dc","status":"published","slug":"tutorship","title":"Chromatone Tutorship","sort":3,"youtube_video":null,"description":"Personal guidance for independent students and practitioners of audio-visual arts and crafts","url":"https://tutor.chromatone.center/","end_date":null,"start_date":"2024-06-01","github":"https://github.com/chromatone/tutor","field":["education","web-app","community","development","projects"],"content":"As Denis, the author and developer of Chromatone, I'm excited to share my profound experience in learning music with colors.

My aim is to support you every step of the way, removing obstacles and opening up new possibilities in your musical exploration.\\n\\nAs your personal tutor, I'll be there to answer your questions, provide feedback, and help you chart your unique musical path. While my focus is on individual guidance, I'm also planning to introduce group sessions and open events in the future for those interested in collaborative learning experiences.\\n\\nThe world of visual music, building on Isaac Newton's ideas, has incredible potential to transform how we understand and create music. It allows people from all backgrounds and skill levels to compose and play together, creating deep connections as we sync up at particular frequencies.\\n\\nI'm thrilled at the prospect of working closely with passionate learners like you. Together, we'll explore the infinite possibilities of music, using color as our guide.

It is light-weight, easy to grasp and straightforward to apply. It doesn’t impose implementation constraints. It brings an active principle of quality to documentation that helps maintainers think effectively about their own work.","team":[3],"updates":[13],"events":[],"program":{"title":"Visual Music Theory"},"cover":{"id":"4b5ac90b-400e-428e-bd49-0778cf8e2841"}},{"id":"01cd6c04-1a1f-415a-8585-4458b5319662","status":"published","slug":"academy-lms","title":"Academy Infrastructure","sort":17,"youtube_video":null,"description":"Open source Learning Management System built with Vue App + Nuxt Server + Directus API + Postgres DB","url":"https://academy.chromatone.center","end_date":"2024-08-01","start_date":"2024-01-24","github":"https://github.com/chromatone/academy","field":["education","web-app","nuxt","vue","directus"],"content":"Chromatone Academy grows from the moment Chromatone came up to Nuxt for server-side infrastructure.

And there is a place with beautiful and quite musical looking architectural composition, like a small light, almost transparent amphitheater. Quite an inspiring place!\\n\\nWe were lucky to meet Parin from Glowfish, who've shown us the place and shared the inspiration to make a Chromatone event right there, like in a couple of months later.

Each module consists of 3-5 lessons 15-30 minutes each. We go through all the topics with the use of Chromatone web-apps and different instruments. Learners get custom designed sticker sheets from the company by mail and have some instrumental videos to shoot for the homework.\\n\\n-------\\n\\n## Программа курса\\n\\nВас ждут вебинары и практика для закрепления навыков.\\n\\n\\n- **11** модулей \\n- **35** онлайн-занятий\\n\\n### 1.
